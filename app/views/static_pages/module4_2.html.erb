First, I think you should put pills on the counter or by the sink in the bathroom. A lot of my patients do that, and they say it helps them to remember to take their medicines every day. The second thing that I want you to do is to read labels when you shop so you can keep track of the salt and other things that could be making your blood presure high. Here's a brochure that can help you read labels. The third thing that I want you to do is to start walking for a half hour every day. That will help make a difference in lowering your blood pressure. I am also going to increase the dosage of your blood pressure medication today. That's what I will recommend today.</li>
